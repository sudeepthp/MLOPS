# MLOPS - Machine Learning Operations Automation

This repository demonstrates the use of MLOps principles to automate the full machine learning lifecycle. It showcases an end-to-end ML workflow, from data preprocessing to model training, evaluation, and interpretability.

## Features
- **Jupyter Notebooks**: Code for model training, evaluation, and analysis.
- **AutoML**: Outputs using H2O AutoML (leaderboard, best models).
- **Model Interpretability**: SHAP and LIME visualizations for understanding model predictions.
- **Pickle Files**: Preprocessing tools (e.g., `iris_scaler.pkl`).

## Usage
1. Clone the repository.
2. Install dependencies.
3. Run Jupyter notebooks to reproduce experiments.

## Requirements
- Python
- H2O AutoML
- SHAP, LIME
